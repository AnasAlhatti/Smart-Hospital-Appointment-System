# 🏥 Smart Hospital System

> A comprehensive, full-stack web application for managing hospital operations, appointments, and medical records. Built with a hybrid architecture using **Spring Boot (Java)** and **React.js**, and deployed on **AWS Cloud**.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Smart Hospital System** connects patients, doctors, and administrators in a secure digital environment. It streamlines the healthcare process by allowing patients to book appointments instantly, doctors to manage prescriptions with real-time FDA drug data, and admins to oversee hospital staff.

**Key Architecture:**
* **Hybrid Frontend:** Combines **Thymeleaf (SSR)** for secure authentication pages and **React.js (SPA)** for a dynamic, responsive dashboard.
* **Secure Backend:** Powered by **Spring Boot** with **Spring Security** (Role-Based Access Control).
* **Stateful Auth:** Uses secure **HttpOnly Cookies (JSESSIONID)** instead of local storage tokens to prevent XSS attacks.

### 1. Landing & Authentication
The entry point for all users. We use a hybrid approach where the landing page and login forms are Server-Side Rendered (Thymeleaf) for security and speed.
